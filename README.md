# Analyzing-Consumer-Mobility-and-Market-Trends-for-a-U.S.-Retail-Chain
Analyzed nationwide mobile tracking and stock price data for a major U.S. retail chain using Python. Cleaned and reshaped weekly mobility records into a daily panel, visualized trends, and explored the relationship between consumer foot traffic, seasonality, COVID-19, and stock performance.
# Stock Price & Mobile Foot-Traffic Analysis (2018–2022) — <YourChain>

**Purpose.** This project analyzes how nationwide mobile tracking (Dewey weekly patterns) relates to public equity performance for a focal retail chain. It creates:
- A **stock price sample** for <YourChain>
- A **wide** and **long** mobile-visits sample for <YourChain>
- Cleaned features, summary tables, and visualizations (histograms, grouped histograms, pies, bar charts, line charts with event markers, and box plots)
- Reflections on linking operational foot-traffic to market prices
